Yes Chief, I see exactly where you’re going — right now the UI has the bones (preset parlays, top picks, million-dollar parlay button), but it’s still missing the meat that would make this app the killer “Prop Finder + Live Edge” machine. Let me point out what can be leveled up from your screenshots and vision:

⸻

🔍 What’s Missing / Where We Can Make It Better

1. Game Zones → Prop Finder Deep-Dive
	•	Right now: You see buttons/presets, but it’s generic “Top Picks.”
	•	Better: A Game Zone browser where you tap “Marlins vs Braves” → drill down into:
	•	Pitchers: pitch mix % (fastball %, slider %, changeup, etc.), velocity, last 5 outings.
	•	Batters: splits vs that pitch type (e.g. “Acuna hits .340 vs sliders, .220 vs changeups”), chase/contact rates, HR probability.
	•	Head-to-Head matchup view: 1–on–1 batter vs pitcher history.
	•	Context factors: park factor (wind, dimensions), umpire tendencies, weather overlay.
	•	This becomes Prop Finder Gold — you don’t just see “Top 20 HR props,” you see why they’re hot today.

2. Dynamic Daily Refresh
	•	Top-20 props should rebuild automatically every morning (via data job).
	•	Pitcher/batter stats should update hourly (or pregame + live scratch updates).
	•	NFL/NBA: same system but for QB vs defense splits, WR vs CB matchups, pace-of-play factors.

3. Live Adjustments (game-day injuries/subs)
	•	MLB: If the starting pitcher is scratched → instantly flip to backup, auto-update prop edges.
	•	NFL: If QB goes out → update “backup QB profile” (college data, limited pro snaps).
	•	NBA: If a star scratches → recalc usage bumps (who gets the extra shots/minutes).
	•	Show this as an alert in app: “Strider scratched, Dylan Dodd starting. Refreshing edges now.”
That’s the hook that makes people stay live inside the app.

4. Prop Categories with Drill-In Reasons
	•	Not just “Top 20 HR props,” but “Top 20 HR props + tap for Why.”
	•	Example: “Acuna Jr. HR (+320) — 17% HR vs LHP sliders, 96 EV, wind blowing out +9 mph.”
	•	These “reasons” should be auto-generated from stats and models so users feel the edge is transparent.

5. User Experience Flow (make it clean)
	•	Landing Tab: Million-Dollar Parlay button (shiny, animated).
	•	Below: 3-Pick / 4-Pick / 5-Pick Builder.
	•	Next Section: “Browse Games” → MLB/NFL/NBA schedule for today.
	•	Tap a game → see all props and advanced matchup info (pitcher/batter, QB/WR, etc.).
	•	Slip: accessible floating button → shows all added legs, est. payout, EV.

6. Long-Term Killer Additions
	•	Custom EV Score: show estimated hit probability and “Edge %” on each pick.
	•	Simulation View: run a 10k Monte Carlo sim for your parlay (just a bar chart of outcomes).
	•	Community Sharing: people can share their “3-Pick” or “Million-Dollar Parlay” combos → upvote system.
	•	Alerts: push notifications when props shift due to scratches or weather.
	•	Player Cards: persistent pages for stars (Acuna, Judge, Mahomes, Curry) with rolling stats & prop histories.

	•	Pitch Mix: 52% sinker, 22% changeup, 18% slider, 8% fastball
	•	Last 5 starts: ERA, strikeouts, walks, pitch counts
	2.	Batter Tab (scrollable lineup)
	•	Ronald Acuna Jr.

	•	vs changeup: .210 AVG, 28% K rate
	•	HR % vs RHP at home: 8%

	•	Weather: Dome closed → neutral
	•	Umpire: strikeout-friendly (K rate +12%)
	4.	Live Factor
	•	If Alcantara scratched → auto-swap to reliever/backup with stats.
	•	Push alert: “Lineup change — pitcher scratched, edges updated.”

🔥 Why this makes the vision elite
	•	Nobody else (not DraftKings, not FanDuel) is handing you matchup context in-game form — they just show odds.
	•	This makes You’re Welcome / Prop Finder not just a book clone but the scouting dashboard for every bettor.
	•	Tie it to your presets: the 3-Pick / 4-Pick / 5-Pick and the Million-Dollar Parlay are fed by this Game Zone engine.

👉 Chief, want me to turn this “Game Zone Prop Finder” into a dev-ready build spec (with database schema + API calls) next, so you can hand it straight off with the Parlay updates? That way your devs know exactly how to wire pitcher pitch mix + batter splits into the app.
